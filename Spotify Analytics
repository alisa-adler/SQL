# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

-- What are 10 most popular songs?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

-- Show artist name, track name and song popularity for 2 artists.
SELECT s.artist_name, s.track_name, s.popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata s
WHERE s.artist_name IN ('Olivia Rodrigo', 'The Weeknd')
ORDER BY s.artist_name;

-- Singers who have more than 1 song in a top chart.
SELECT artist_name, COUNT (track_name) number_of_songs
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING number_of_songs >1
ORDER BY number_of_songs desc;

--Calculated the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table, showed every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above and labeled them as a “Top Star”.
WITH popularity_average_CTE AS (
SELECT s.artist_name,
AVG(s.popularity) AS average_popularity
FROM SpotifyData s 
GROUP BY s.artist_name)
SELECT  artist_name, average_popularity, 'Top Star' AS tag
FROM popularity_average_CTE
WHERE average_popularity>=90;
